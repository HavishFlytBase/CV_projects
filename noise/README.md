# Noise

This folder contains a tutorial that describes 2 different noise types white noise and colored/correlated noise. 
These noise types are explored in 2 dimensions for intuitive visualization. This is a hands on tutorial that aims
to show how to use different signal processing techniques to describes signals or noise. The objective is to
understand these intuitively and learn to use them. These techniques include: 
Estimating the covariance matrix, Autocorrelation, and Power Spectral Desnisty (PSD)
