# Multi Task Depth Segmentation

Tutorial for Deep Multi Task Learning, where we will learn how to train a single model to perform both claassificaiton and regression tasks simultaneously. 
This model is intended for speed and efficiency with the radeoff being a slight reduction in accuracy. We will use a MobileNetV3 encoder and a Light weight Refine Net decoder.
After the decoder, we will be able to add multiple heads for multiple different tasks. The tutorial is documented in this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-task-architectures-9bee2e080456) featured on Towards Data Science.
